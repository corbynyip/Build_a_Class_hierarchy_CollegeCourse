# Build_a_Class_hierarchy_CollegeCourse
Create class hierarchy to implement a college course. The course has a list of assessments: coding assignments, participation quizzes, and exams. Make polymorphic calls for each type of assessment to obtain its respective information. Each level of class hierarchy will be responsible for its own data and for adding it to the assessment info.
